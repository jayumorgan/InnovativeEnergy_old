# Client
The client contains 3 JavaScript files that may be of interest to a developer:
- `ui.js`: We reccommend that you write all of your client-side logic in this file
- `widgets.js`: Contains reusable UI widgets (textboxes, dropdowns, etc) that you can use in `ui.js`
- `index.js`: Contains generic logic that you should alter only if you really need to

Additionally, we reccommend only altering the stylings of your application via `styles/ui.css`,
as `styles/index.css` is intended for MachineApp template generic logic.
